Larsen, Fitzgerald, Woodcock, Nilsson, Gamble, and Foster
\cite{isola-2016-larsen}
({\em Towards Semantically Integrated Models and Tools forCyber-Physical Systems Design})
argue that the modeling of specifically embedded 
cyber-physical systems best can be done using multiple 
formalisms. A case study of a small unmannedaerial vehicle is used to demonstrate the need for multiple formalisms, namely a formalism for defining control, in this case VDM-RT, and a formalism for continuous behavior defined by differential equations, in this case 20-sim. The integration is founded in the semantic framework of Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). Combined systems are suggested simulated via
a co-simulation framework.
