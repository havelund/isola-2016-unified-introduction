({\em Towards a Unified View of Modeling and Programming})
present an argument for unifying modeling and programming in one 
formalism. They highlight relevant developments in the fields 
of formal methods, model-based engineering, and programming 
languages. They subsequently illustrate how modeling can be 
perceived as programing via examples in the Scala 
programming language. The paper concludes with a summary of
issues considered important to reflect on in any attempt to 
unify modeling and programming.
