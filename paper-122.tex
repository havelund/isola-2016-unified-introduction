The panel section started with a presentation by
Broy, Havelund, and Kumar
\cite{isola-2016-broy}
({\em Towards a Unified View of Modeling and Programming}),
who present an argument for unifying modeling and programming in 
one formalism. They highlight relevant developments in the fields 
of formal methods, model-based engineering, and programming 
languages. They subsequently illustrate how modeling can be 
perceived as programing via examples in the Scala 
programming language. The paper concludes with a summary of
issues considered important to reflect on in any attempt to 
unify modeling and programming. They specifically highlight
the need to combine textual and visual languages, the need for
allowing definition of domain-specific languages, and the need for analysis support.
