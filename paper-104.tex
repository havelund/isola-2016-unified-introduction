Rouquette
\cite{isola-2016-rouquette}
({\em Simplifying OMG MOF-based Metamodeling})
discusses the complexity of UML, the meta-model MOF used to 
define it, and the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) standard
used for serializing UML models. He alternatively suggests
to define the abstract syntax of a modeling language as 
a normalized relational schema, and to consider a particular
model as tabular instance of that schema. 
He finally suggests leveraging recent advances in functional programming languages, such as Scala, in order 
to modernize the traditional practice of model-basedprogramming with the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and theQuery/View/Transformation (QVT) standards.
