({\em Unifying Modelling and Programming: A Systems Biology Perspective})
suggests to explore the topic of unifying modeling and programming
in the context of computational systems biology, which is a field 
in its early stages, and therefore potentially more receptive to 
new ideas. Here, for example cells
can be effectively described as biological programs.
Software and system development share several of the main 
challenges that computational systemsbiology is facing : 
making models amendable to formal and scalable reasoning,
using visual languages, combining different programming
languages, rapid prototyping, and program synthesis.
