({\em Systems Modeling and Programming in aUnified Environment based on Julia})
present a new methodology for modeling cyber physical systems using a Modelica-like extension of the powerful Julia programming language -- a language extension they call Modia. A good discussion is provided by the authors regarding the needs of a Model Based Systems Engineering approach, along with a strong description of the features and implementation of the Modia language. Examples and illustrations are also provided in great detail.
